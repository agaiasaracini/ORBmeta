\title{
Function to adjust for outcome reporting bias (ORB) in a random-effect meta-analysis and conduct sensitivity analyses, according to the methodology developed by Copas et al. (2014) with extensions.
}
\description{
An implementation of the Copas et al. (2014) method to adjust for outcome reporting bias (ORB) in meta-anlyses of clinical trials for the random-effect model for beneficial outcomes, and extention to harmful outcomes (see Details). The \code{ORBsens} function can take in binary outcome data (i.e., the user should provide \code{a}, \code{c}, \code{n1}, \code{n2}), as well as means and standard errors (i.e., the user should provide \code{mu1}, \code{mu2}, \code{sd1}, \code{sd2}, \code{n1}, \code{n2}). The outcome variable is reported for some studies, and unreported for others. The unreported studies should have entries "high", i.e., high risk of bias, or "low", i.e., low risk of bias. The risk of bias classification should be done according to the ORBIT methodology. For the method to work, the sample sizes are required for all studies (reported and unreported). The function includes uncertainty in the risk of bias classification through the \code{p_vals} or \code{eta_vals} for beneficial and harmful outcomes respectively (see Details).

\details{

For a beneficial outcome, the log-likelihood to be maximized to obtain an ORB-adjusted estimate of the treatment effect \eqn{\mu} is

\deqn{

l_{\rho_{1}, \rho_{2}} (\mu, \tau^2, \alpha, \beta) = \\
\sum_{ i \in \text{Rep}} \log  [f_{i}(y_{i})] +
N_{R} \log (\alpha) +
N_{R \cap s} \log (\beta) + \\
\sum_{i \in \text{HR}} \log [\rho_{1} \alpha Q_{i} (1 - \beta) + (1 - \rho_{2})(1 - \alpha) ] + \\
\sum_{i \in \text{LR}} \log [(1-\rho_{1})\alpha Q_{i}(1-\beta) + \rho_{2}(1-\alpha) ]


}

where \eqn{\mu} the global treatment effect, \eqn{\tau^2} is the the between-study heterogeneity, \eqn{\alpha} is the probability of an outcome being measured, and \eqn{\beta} is the probability an outcome being reported given that it was measured and non-significant. The \eqn{\rho_{1}, \rho_{2}} reliability parameters are treated as fixed. \eqn{\rho_{1}} is defined as the probability that an outcome is classified as high risk of bias given that it was measured, non-significant, and unreported. \eqn{\rho_{2}} is the probability that an outcome is classified as low risk of bias given that it was not measured and was not reported. \eqn{Q_i} is the probability of the observed treatment effect \eqn{y_i} being significant, while \eqn{f_i(y_i)} is the pdf of a normal distribution. See Copas et al. (2014) for more details and for the derivation of the log-likelihood function.

For a harmful outcome, the log-likelihood to be maximized is

\deqn{

L_{\eta_{1}, \eta_{2}} (\mu, \tau^2, \alpha, \gamma)  = \\
\sum_{i \in \text{Rep}} \log [f_{i}(y_{i}) ] + N_{\text{R}} \log (\alpha) + N_{\text{R} \cap P } \log (\gamma) +\\
\sum_{i \in \text{LR}} \log [\alpha Q_{h_i} (1-\gamma) (1-\eta_1) + (1-\alpha)\eta_2 ] + \\
\sum_{i \in \text{HR}} \log [\alpha Q_{h_i} (1-\gamma) \eta_1 + (1-\alpha)(1-\eta_2) ]

}

where \eqn{\mu} the global treatment effect,\eqn{\tau^2} is the the between-study heterogeneity, \eqn{\alpha} is the probability of an outcome being measured, and \eqn{\gamma} is the probability an outcome being reported given that it was measured and positive. The \eqn{\eta_{1}, \eta_{2}} reliability parameters are treated as fixed. \eqn{\eta_{1}} is defined as the probability that an outcome is classified as high risk of bias given that it was measured, positive, and unreported. \eqn{\eta_{2}} is the probability that an outcome is classified as low risk of bias given that it was not measured and was not reported.
