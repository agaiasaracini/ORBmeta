\title{
Simulate Meta-Analysis Data with ORB
}
\description{
The \code{simulate_meta_data} function generates simulated data for a meta-analysis for a beneficial outcome of a randomized controlled trials (RCTs) so as to include ORB. It creates a dataset of studies with the following variables: sample sizes in treatment and control, observed treatment effects, standard errors, and one-sided p-values.

First, it generates a meta-analysis according to the random-effect model, where all studies have the same sample sizes for treatment and control. Then, it removes studies to simulate ORB and replaces some treatment effects and standard errors with high risk of bias ("high") or low risk of bias ("low").

Unreported studies at high risk of bias ("high") are removed according to the following selection function: \deqn{exp(-4 \cdot p_i^\gamma)} used in Copas and Henmi (2010), representing the probability of reporting the outcome as a function of the one-sided p-value: \deqn{p_i = \Phi(- \frac{y_i}{\sigma_i})}.

Among the studies which are left reported, a number between 1 and the number of "high" ones is chosen to classified as low risk of bias ("low").

If there are less than 3 reported studies, the function chooses at random among the "high" and "low" ones some to be turned back into reported, so as to guarantee that at least 3 are reported.

\arguments{

  \item{n_studies}{
The number of studies in the meta-analysis.
}
\item{mu}{
The true treatment effect \eqn{\mu}.
}
\item{tau_squared}{
The true heterogeneity parameter \eqn{\tau^2}.
}
\item{n_treatment=50}{
The sample size in the control. This will be the same across all studies.
}
\item{n_control=50}{
The sample size in the treatment. This will be the same across all studies.
}

\item{gamma}{
The parameter for ORB modeling, controlling the probability of studies reporting "high". Higher values of gamma result in a higher probability of reporting "high". Based on Copas and Henmi (2010).
}


}
\details{

The y treatment effect is assumed to for a beneficial outcomes, where a positive/significant value indicates a beneficial effect of treatment on that outcome.

}
\value{

The function returns a dataset with the following columns
\item{study}{
Study IDs, i.e., a number from 1 to the number of studies chosen for the simualted meta-analysis.
}
\item{n_control}{
Sizes of control groups, equal across all studies.
}

\item{n_treatment}{
Sizes of treatment groups, equal across all studies.
}

\item{y}{Observed treatment effect. It will be reported for some studies, and "high" or "low" for others.}

\item{s}{Observed standard error. It will be reported for some studies, and "high" or "low" for others.}

\item{p_value}{The one-sided p-values used to generate "high" studies.}

\item{s_true}{The true standard errors before ORB is simualted and some are removed.}
